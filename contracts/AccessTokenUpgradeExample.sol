/*
 * This is an example of how we would upgrade the AccessToken contract if we had to.
 * Instead of doing a full data migration from ACTv1 to ACTv2, we could make
 * use of inheritance to keep the old functionality we want and change what is needed.
 * We could then contact the old contract to retrieve old balances.
 *
 * NOTE: This should probably only be done once because every subsequent
 * update will get more confusing. If we really have to update the ACT
 * contract we should investigate then whether we should just use
 * the same proxy pattern we are using for the POA contract.
